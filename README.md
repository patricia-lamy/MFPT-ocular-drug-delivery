In the folder `Code_figures_human_ensemble`,
- The file `set_human_ensemble.ipynb` compiles the geometries used for the human ensemble, and produces Figure 4 in the manuscript.
- The file `mfpt_human_ensemble.ipynb` produces the MFPT results for the human ensemble geometries, corresponding to Figure 7b in the manuscript and Figure S1.5.1 in the Supplementary Information 1.
- The file `vr_exit_human_ensemble.ipynb` produces the results of the proportion of drug exiting through the vitreous-retina interface, corresponding to Figure 9 in the manuscript.

In the folder `Code_other_figures`,
- The file `figure_mfpt_comparison_species.ipynb` produces the results for the Figure 7a in the manuscript.
- The file `figure_density_over_time.ipynb`, along with the data in `Data/drug_qty_over_time_P2.csv`, produce results for Figure S1.1.2 in the Supplementary Information 1.
